#Texas Hold'em GUI
##Fall Term Full Project #1

###Goal
The goal of this project was to practice writing GUI code, but it turned into so much more than that. Things like concurrency and synchronization while  *incorrectly* implemented, were tested in this project. I learned how to separate git commits to related sets and I learned the reasons why certain paradigms like View-Model-Controller make so much sense. This project has taken a little over two months, and while there is a lot more that could be done with it I think that it is wholly usable and in a finished state. This entire project has been a huge benefit to me. Onwards and Upwards!
