#Texas Hold'em GUI
##Fall Term Full Project #1

###Goal
The goal of this project was to practice writing GUI code, but it has turned into so much more than that. Things like concurrency were *incorrectly* implemented in this project. Even so I now know the reasons why certain paradigms like View - Model - Controller make so much sense. This project has taken a little over two months, and while there is a lot more that could be done with it I think that it is wholly useable. Midway through I started to follow more consistent git practices as well so this entire project has been a huge benefit to me. Onwards and Upwards!
