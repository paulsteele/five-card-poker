Fall Term Full Project #1

A five card draw poker terminal based game

This will be the first Full Project that I do for fall semester.

It supports essentially unlimited number of players(1 human, the rest AI). This isn't really practical as a deck only has so many cards but the code supports it. A hard cap will be established at some point.
