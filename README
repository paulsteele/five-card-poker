Fall Term Full Project #1

A Texas hold em GUI!!!

This is no longer five card draw, this might as well by legit

This project has not followed consistent git practices. Each commit is essentially where I stopped for the day. The next project will utilize branches and feature based commits

This will be the first Full Project that I do for fall semester.

It supports essentially unlimited number of players(1 human, the rest AI). This isn't really practical as a deck only has so many cards but the code supports it. A hard cap will be established at some point.

This is now going to be a GUI application. Might as well implement it before too much work is done on it
